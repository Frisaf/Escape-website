                    <p>Even though the game was made by one single developer who goes by the name Frisaf online, improvements could not have been made without the developer's friends who acted as playtesters!</p>
                    <p><strong>Big thanks to:</strong></p>

                        <p>Thanks to your silly playstyle, I was able to identify several bugs with how the players moved and answered to the game's questions.</p>
                        <li><strong>Tilli</strong></li>
                        <p>Thanks to your thorough playthrough, I was able to identify a few spelling mistakes and a few bugs in the game's early development days.</p>
                        <li><strong>Rasmus</strong></li>
                        <p>Your playthrough right made me sure I had fixed the bugs Tilli pointed out.</p>
                        <li><strong>Charlie</strong></li>
                        <p>Thanks for finding my spelling mistakes!</p>
                        <li><strong>Bianca</strong></li>
                        <p>You found several bugs within the games that I could fix. On top of that, you also helped me find places where the game's instructions were rather unclear.</p>
                        <li><strong>Jens</strong></li>
                        <p>Thanks for being an amazing teacher and giving me the idea to make this game! Thanks to your guidance, I was able to overcome some of the problems I had at the beginning of the game's development, such as the giant if-loop.</p>
